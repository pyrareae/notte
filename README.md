# Notte
## A note keeping demo in multiple implementations

# Implementations
There are 3 roles the projects can have, SPA app, MPA app, and API server. Some of the servers can fill multiple roles. The SPA apps need a running api server to function.

|Directory|Server|Client|Notes|finished?|
|---------|------|------|-----|---------|
|notte-rails|HOTW/API|MPA||90%|
|notte-laravel|MPA/API|MPA||No|
|notte-vue|No|SPA||WIP|
|notte-angular-legacy|No|SPA||No|

*HOTW: HTML Over The Wire  
*MPA: Multi Page Application, i.e., traditional server rendered pages  
*SPA: Single Page Application  

## notte-rails
This is the first one and the reference. Basic Rails 7 server. Using the new jsbundling asset pipeline. This is using html over the wire for the server ui and runs a json api for use with spa apps. I've skipped Devise and opted for a simple auth system because I felt like it.

### Remarks

Rails is my "good ol' reliable" and usually "just works", but I'm used to using it. It gives you a lot for free, which is nice. The new HTML over the wire features are pretty nice and result in a snappy UI in this demo, without the fuss of using a full blown SPA.
