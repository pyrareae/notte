# Notte
## A note keeping demo in multiple implementations

# Implementations
There are 3 roles the projects can have, SPA app, MPA app, and API server. Some of the servers can fill multiple roles. The SPA apps need a running api server to function.

## notte-rails
Basic Rails 7 server. Using the new jsbundling asset pipeline. This is using html over the wire for the server ui and runs a json api for use with spa apps. I've skipped Devise and opted for a simple auth system because I felt like it.
